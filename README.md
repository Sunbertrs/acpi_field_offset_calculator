# acpi_field_offset_calculator
A little script for calculating the offset value of field in ACPI.

When working on my Hackintosh, I encountered an issue where the battery level on my computer could not be displayed. After tinkering with it for a while, I tried to modify the byte usage of each variable in the DSDT as suggested by others, but it turned out to be a hassle. So, I writed a small script to make it easier to calculate the offset values. The script is very poorly written, please bear with me.
